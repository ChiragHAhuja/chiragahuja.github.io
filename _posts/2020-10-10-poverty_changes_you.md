An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.

Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.

Poverty changes you.

Feedback loop/

    - no job. nobody gives you a job. experience.
    - grow ugly. which further hampers your ability to get a job
    - you just sleep hoping that if you sleep, the hunger will somehow go away.
    - loose friends since no wants to associate with a ugly person without a job
    - thin pants wont fit. you look anaemic. thus driving friends/employer further away from you

I think I know what money seems to me now. It represents endless supply of food and freedom. Freedom to work on the problems that I want to work on.
